# @elizaos/plugin-imessage

iMessage plugin for elizaOS agents. Uses Apple's Messages app on macOS or a
Blooio channel on any supported server platform.

Native mode requires macOS. Blooio mode supports Linux servers.

## Features

- **Send Messages**: Send text messages via iMessage
- **Direct & Group Chats**: Support for direct messages and group conversations
- **Attachments**: Rehost inbound Messages files into the canonical media store and send bounded local or SSRF-guarded remote media through Messages.app
- **Message Polling**: Receive incoming messages via polling
- **Policy Controls**: Configure DM and group policies
- **Blooio Webhook**: Receive signed events at `/api/imessage/webhook/blooio`
- **Channel Isolation**: Dispatch only the configured Blooio channel

## Requirements

- **macOS**: This plugin only works on macOS
- **Messages App Access**: Full Disk Access is required for reads; Automation permission is required for sends
- **No Relay Required**: BlueBubbles, local servers, auxiliary CLIs, and external services are not used

## Installation

```bash
# npm
npm install @elizaos/plugin-imessage

# bun
bun add @elizaos/plugin-imessage
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `IMESSAGE_DB_PATH` | Path to iMessage database | No |
| `IMESSAGE_POLL_INTERVAL_MS` | Polling interval in ms | No |
| `IMESSAGE_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_MS` | Heartbeat health-check interval in ms (default `60000`) | No |
| `IMESSAGE_DM_POLICY` | DM policy: open, pairing, allowlist, disabled | No |
| `IMESSAGE_GROUP_POLICY` | Group policy: open, allowlist, disabled | No |
| `IMESSAGE_ALLOW_FROM` | Comma-separated handles for allowlist | No |
| `IMESSAGE_ENABLED` | Enable/disable the plugin | No |
| `IMESSAGE_BACKFILL` | Rows before current DB tip to replay on startup | No |
| `IMESSAGE_TRANSPORT` | `native` (default) or `blooio` | No |
| `IMESSAGE_BLOOIO_API_KEY` | Blooio API key; falls back to `BLOOIO_API_KEY` | Blooio |
| `IMESSAGE_BLOOIO_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Webhook signing secret; falls back to `BLOOIO_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Blooio |
| `IMESSAGE_BLOOIO_FROM_NUMBER` | E.164 sender number; falls back to `BLOOIO_FROM_NUMBER` | Blooio |
| `IMESSAGE_BLOOIO_CHANNEL_ID` | Exact Blooio channel accepted by this agent | Blooio |

### Agent Configuration

```json
{
  "plugins": ["@elizaos/plugin-imessage"],
  "pluginParameters": {
    "IMESSAGE_DM_POLICY": "pairing",
    "IMESSAGE_GROUP_POLICY": "allowlist",
    "IMESSAGE_POLL_INTERVAL_MS": "5000"
  }
}
```

## Setup

### Blooio on Linux

Set `IMESSAGE_TRANSPORT=blooio` and all four Blooio settings above. Create a
channel-scoped Blooio webhook for the configured channel pointing to:

```text
https://YOUR_AGENT_HOST/api/imessage/webhook/blooio
```

Subscribe to `message.received`. The route verifies `X-Blooio-Signature`
against the unmodified request body and silently ignores other channel IDs.

### Permissions

1. Open System Settings > Privacy & Security > Full Disk Access
2. Grant Full Disk Access to:
   - Your terminal app (or the Eliza process)
3. Allow Messages app to be controlled via AppleScript (Automation permission)

## Usage

### Actions

iMessage sending is exposed through the canonical message connector action. Use
`source: "imessage"` when a request needs to target iMessage explicitly.

| Primary action | Operation | Description |
|----------------|-----------|-------------|
| `MESSAGE` | `send` | Send a text message to a phone number, email, contact, or chat |

### Providers

iMessage does not register standalone planner providers. Chat and contact
context is exposed through the iMessage message connector hooks.

## How It Works

The plugin uses two local macOS surfaces: read-only SQLite access to
`~/Library/Messages/chat.db` for inbound history and Apple's built-in
AppleScript interface to Messages.app for outbound delivery. It does not run a
relay server or delegate to a third-party executable.

### AppleScript Method

```applescript
tell application "Messages"
  set targetService to 1st account whose service type = iMessage
  set targetBuddy to participant "+1234567890" of targetService
  send "Hello!" to targetBuddy
end tell
```

## Message Targets

iMessage supports multiple target types:

- **Phone Numbers**: `+1234567890`, `1234567890`
- **Email Addresses**: `user@example.com`
- **Chat IDs**: `chat_id:UUID` (for existing chats)

## Policies

### DM Policies

| Policy | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `open` | Accept DMs from anyone |
| `pairing` (default) | Accept senders in `IMESSAGE_ALLOW_FROM` immediately; hold unknown senders through the core PairingService handshake — they are admitted once the owner approves their pairing code (`pairing approve imessage <code>` or the pairing UI). The pairing-code reply is only texted to the sender when `IMESSAGE_AUTO_REPLY=true` |
| `allowlist` | Only accept from IMESSAGE_ALLOW_FROM list |
| `disabled` | Don't accept any DMs |

### Group Policies

| Policy | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `open` | Respond to anyone in groups |
| `allowlist` | Only respond to allowed users |
| `disabled` | Don't respond in groups |

## Limitations

- **Native mode is macOS-only**: Blooio mode is the supported server transport
- **No Official API**: Sending uses Messages.app's supported AppleScript dictionary
- **Permissions**: Message history requires Full Disk Access, sending through
  Messages requires Automation, and contact resolution/editing requires
  Contacts access
- **Rate Limits**: Apple may throttle excessive automation

## Development

### Building

```bash
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-imessage build
```

### Testing

Testing requires a macOS environment with Messages app configured:

```bash
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-imessage test
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Cannot access Messages app"

1. Ensure Full Disk Access is granted
2. Ensure Automation permissions are granted if sending through Messages fails
3. Try opening Messages app manually first

### "Service not available"

1. Check that you're running on macOS
2. Verify the Messages app is installed and configured

### Messages not sending

1. Check that iMessage is signed in and working
2. Verify the recipient has iMessage enabled
3. Check for rate limiting (try again later)
