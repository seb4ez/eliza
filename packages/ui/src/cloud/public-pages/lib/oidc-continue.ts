/**
 * Destination resolution and issuer-session preparation for the OIDC sign-in
 * bounce (`/oidc/continue`).
 *
 * The Eliza Cloud OpenID Provider lives on the API origin, but its `/authorize`
 * endpoint can only send a signed-out browser to the console's `/login`, whose
 * `returnTo` is sanitized to a SAME-ORIGIN PATH and therefore cannot carry an
 * absolute URL back. The provider instead parks the validated request and hands
 * over an opaque id; this module turns that id into the absolute resume URL.
 *
 * The destination origin is the ORIGIN OF THE CONFIGURED ISSUER — the build-time
 * `VITE_OIDC_ISSUER_URL`, which must hold the same string the Worker reads as
 * `OIDC_ISSUER_URL`. The hosted consoles get it from the `build:web` env blocks
 * in `.github/workflows/cloud-cf-deploy.yml`, which carry the same per-environment
 * values as the `OIDC_ISSUER_URL` vars in `packages/cloud/api/wrangler.toml`.
 *
 * It is never taken from a query parameter: a caller-supplied origin would make
 * `/oidc/continue` an open redirect for anyone who can link to it. It is not
 * guessed from the console host either; the provider answers only on the one host
 * its issuer names, so a guess that misses lands on a host where the parked
 * request does not exist and the user is told their sign-in expired. Nor is it
 * the console's own origin: the resume leg is authenticated by a per-request
 * binding cookie that `/authorize` set as a HOST-ONLY cookie on the issuer host.
 * Steward's session cookie is also host-only, so this module explicitly syncs
 * the browser's stored Steward token to that issuer origin before resuming.
 *
 * When the issuer is unset, only LOOPBACK development resolves — to the current
 * origin, where the dev server proxies `/api` and the binding cookie therefore
 * belongs to that origin — and every other host resolves to nothing so the page
 * can say which variable is missing.
